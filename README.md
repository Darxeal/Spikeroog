# Spikeroog

A custom Rocket League bot made for the Spike Rush gamemode with the [RLBot](https://www.rlbot.org) framework. It can do powerful flick shots, ceiling shots and the humanly impossible wall dash technique. You can watch it play in the [SpikeBorne tournament](https://youtu.be/2a7K3sn3zNY).

It uses a slightly edited and trimmed version of [RLUtilities by chip](https://github.com/samuelpmish/RLUtilities).

To compile it, you need CMake and a C++ compiler (Visual Studio with C++ tools for example). Then you can run `build.bat`, and find the output in `Spikeroog/release`.

Or you can get a ready to use version in the Releases tab. Just load `spikeroog.cfg` into your RLBotGUI.
